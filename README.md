Predicting Car Price using Random Forest algorithm
Deciding whether a used car is worth the posted price when you see listings online can be difficult.
Several factors, including mileage, make, model, year, etc. can influence the actual worth of a car. From
the perspective of a seller, it is also a dilemma to price a used car appropriately[2-3]. Based on existing
data, the aim is to use machine learning algorithms to develop models for predicting used car prices.
For this project, we are using the dataset on used car sales from all over the United States, available on
Kaggle. The features available in this dataset are Car Name, Manufecturing Year,	Selling Price,	Present Price, Kms Driven, Fuel Type,	Seller_Type and Transmission.

The model is divided into the following sections:
-Data understanding and exploration
-Data cleaning
-Data preparation
-Model building and evaluation
